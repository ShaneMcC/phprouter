# How to contribute

I'm happy to accept pull requests from anyone, so long as they generally follow the existing codestyle and add general purpose features everyone will find useful.

Fork, then close the repository
Make your changes
Submit a pull request

Once this is done you're waiting on me to approve the pull requests, I might make some comments or request some changes or improvements and I might reject it outright, but I will provide a reason if I do this.
